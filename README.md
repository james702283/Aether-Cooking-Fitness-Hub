## Technology Stack & Architecture

Aether Kitchen & Fitness is a full-stack application built with a modern, robust, and scalable technology stack. The architecture features a decoupled frontend and backend, communicating via a RESTful API.

### Backend (Server-Side)

* **Runtime Environment:** **Node.js**
* **Framework:** **Express.js** for building the RESTful API, routing, and middleware management.
* **Database:** **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for all data persistence.
* **Authentication:** Secure user authentication is handled using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for stateless sessions and **bcryptjs** for password hashing.
* **AI Integration:** Core intelligence is powered by the **Google Generative AI (Gemini) SDK** to provide dynamic recipe and workout suggestions.
* **Image Storage:** **Multer** processes multipart/form-data for file uploads, which are then hosted on the **Cloudinary** cloud platform.
* **Middleware:** Makes use of **CORS** for cross-origin resource sharing, custom authentication middleware for protecting routes, and **dotenv** for managing environment variables.

### Frontend (Client-Side)

* **Build Tool:** **Vite** is used as the lightning-fast build tool and development server.
* **Core Framework:** **React.js (v18+)** utilizing Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`) for state management and lifecycle features.
* **Styling:** A responsive and modern interface built with **Tailwind CSS**, a utility-first CSS framework.
* **API Communication:** **Axios** is used for all asynchronous REST API requests to the backend.
* **UI Components:** Crisp and consistent icons provided by the **Lucide React** library.
* **Data Export:** The application provides client-side data export to `.pdf` format using the **jsPDF** library.

## Getting Started

To get Aether Kitchen & Fitness running on your local machine for development and testing, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (v18 or later recommended)
* **npm** (or yarn)
* **MongoDB:** A running instance of MongoDB or a connection string from a cloud provider like MongoDB Atlas.
* **API Keys:**
    * Cloudinary Account (for `API Key`, `API Secret`, and `Cloud Name`)
    * Google AI API Key

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Setup Backend:**
    * Navigate to the server directory:
        ```sh
        cd server
        ```
    * Install backend dependencies:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following variables:
        ```env
        PORT=5001
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
        GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key

        CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
        CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
        CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
        ```
    * Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

3.  **Setup Frontend:**
    * Navigate back to the root project directory:
        ```sh
        cd ..
        ```
    * Install frontend dependencies:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    * The frontend is configured in `src/App.jsx` to connect to the backend at `http://localhost:5001`. Ensure this matches the `PORT` in your server's `.env` file.

4.  **Running the Application:**
    * **Start the Backend Server:** Open a terminal in the `server` directory and run:
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```
        The server should now be running on the port you specified (e.g., 5001).
    * **Start the Frontend Development Server:** Open a *second* terminal in the root project directory and run:
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```
        Vite will start the development server, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

You should now have the full application running locally.
